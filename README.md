## What is R3?

R3 is a zero-config browser extension that lets anyone — QA leads, developers, non-technical team members — record a web workflow once and replay it with a single click. No test frameworks to install, no scripts to write. Just **Record. Run. Repeat.**

Export your recordings as CSV files and share them with your team. Import them on any machine with the extension installed. That's it.

## Key Features

- **One-click recording** — Click "Start Recording", interact with your app, click "Stop". Done.
- **Smart replay engine** — Polls for elements, dispatches framework-compatible synthetic events, handles SPAs and page navigations.
- **Framework-friendly** — Works with Angular, React, Vue, and vanilla JS apps. Dispatches proper `input`, `change`, and `blur` events for framework state updates.
- **CSV import/export** — Share test cases as simple CSV files. No proprietary formats.
- **SPA support** — Handles client-side navigation, re-injects the player after full page navigations mid-test.
- **Duplicate ID handling** — Finds the first *visible* element when SPAs have multiple elements with the same ID across views.
- **iframe support** — Searches same-origin iframes for elements automatically.
- **Intelligent selectors** — Prioritizes stable selectors: `data-testid` > `id` > `name` > `aria-label` > `placeholder` > CSS path. Filters out dynamic/generated IDs.
- **Visual feedback** — Highlights recorded elements with a red outline during recording.
- **Continue on error** — Optionally skip failed steps and continue the rest of the test.
- **Add Wait steps** — Insert manual wait steps during recording for pages that need extra load time.
- **Auto-save** — Recordings persist in `chrome.storage.local` so nothing is lost if the popup closes.
- **Pop-out window** — Detach the extension into its own window for side-by-side testing.

## CSV Format

R3 uses a simple 4-column CSV schema:

```
Action,Target (Selector),Value (Input Data),Description (Optional)
OPEN,,https://example.com,Open the site
WAIT,,2000,Wait for page load
TYPE,[data-testid='fname'],John,Enter first name
CLICK,#submit-btn,,Click submit
```

| `OPEN` | Navigate to a URL |
| `CLICK` | Click an element |
| `DBLCLICK` | Double-click an element |
| `RIGHTCLICK` | Right-click (context menu) |
| `TYPE` | Set a field's value (final value) |
| `TYPE_CHAR` | Type character-by-character (for autocomplete fields) |
| `CLEAR` | Clear a field |
| `SELECT` | Select a dropdown option |
| `CHECK` | Check a checkbox or radio button |
| `UNCHECK` | Uncheck a checkbox |
| `PRESS` | Press a key (Enter, Tab, Escape) |
| `WAIT` | Wait for a duration (ms) or for an element to appear |
| `ASSERT_EXISTS` | Verify an element exists on the page |
